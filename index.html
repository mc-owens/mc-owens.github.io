        <h2 class="mb-3">Artistic Statement</h2>
        <p>Dance is my gateway to the world and the people around me. I see it as a universal language that allows us to express emotions and ideas beyond words. Through dance, I aim to share the intricacies of human connection while exploring the depth of the human experience.
          Geometrical shapes inspire my personal movement style, as I play with the juxtaposition of angles and curves. Musicality is central to my work, driving movements that oscillate between sharpness, suspension, and flow. I believe in the power of simplicity—when movement is purposeful, even the smallest gesture can leave a profound impact. I also embrace the influence of multiple dance styles, blending techniques to create work that reflects the interconnectedness of art.
          </p>

        <p>In all my work, I strive to create a space for audiences to connect on their own terms. I want viewers to feel something, whether it’s understanding the narrative I’ve crafted or creating their own interpretation. My goal is to evoke emotions and invite reflection, ensuring that each person walks away with something meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>If you had asked me 4 years ago about the relationship between dance and perfection, I would have said that dance strives for perfection. Now, dance is not about that at all, and rather the contrary. It’s about exploration and embracing the endless possibilities, flops, and failures of creation. Through this process, I hope to continue connecting with others and celebrating the beauty of movement as an art form. The road to perfection does not exist, but luckily there are an infinite amount of roads that lead to art. </p>

    <div class="m-5 p-3">
      <h2 class="mb-3">About Me</h2>
      <p> I grew up in Maine, where I began my dance journey at Maine State Ballet, immersing myself in the authentic Balanchine technique. Under the direction of Linda MacArthur Miele, the youngest dancer ever accepted into the New York City Ballet by George Balanchine, I had the privilege of performing some of his most iconic works. This experience gave me a deep appreciation for the strong foundations of ballet, Balanchine's technique, and the crucial elements of performance and musicality.
        My journey continued at Florida Southern College in Lakeland, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Dance Performance and Choreography, along with a major in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. It was here that I discovered the world of modern and contemporary dance, and began to draw connections between my classical ballet training and these new forms. Over time, my dance exploration expanded into styles I had never before encountered, such as hip-hop and heels, which pushed me to challenge myself creatively and technically.
        Currently, I am teaching a heels class to adults, sharing my passion for dance exploration, creativity, and choreography and fostering confidence in others. I am grateful for the diverse experiences and opportunities that have shaped my artistic journey, and I continue to seek ways to blend my technical expertise with my love for creative expression.</p>
